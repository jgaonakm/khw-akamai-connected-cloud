# Prerequisites

On this phase we set up our local environment with the tools required to perform the labs. 

## Linode account

 If needed, you can [create an account here](https://login.linode.com/signup?promo=docs080123)

## Linode SDK

 Follow [this guide](https://www.linode.com/docs/products/tools/cli/guides/install/) to install and configure the Linode CLI.

 Once installed, you can verify it works using

 ```sh
linode profile view
 ```

If it shows the information of the account token used for the configuration, you're ready to move to the next step.

```
│ username       │ email                │ restricted │ two_factor_auth │
├────────────────┼──────────────────────┼────────────┼─────────────────┤
│ [username]     │ id@example.com       │ False      │ True            │
```

## Running Commands in Parallel with tmux

[tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) can be used to run commands on multiple compute instances at the same time. Labs in this tutorial may require running the same commands across multiple compute instances, in those cases consider using tmux and splitting a window into multiple panes with synchronize-panes enabled to speed up the provisioning process.

> The use of tmux is optional and not required to complete this tutorial.

Enable synchronize-panes by pressing `ctrl+b` followed by `shift+:`. Next type `set synchronize-panes on` at the prompt. To disable synchronization: `set synchronize-panes off`. 
 
> You can also change tmux behavior [using a config file](https://linuxhint.com/customize-tmux-configuration/)


## OpenSSL

OpenSSL will be used to generate the certificates required by our cluster. It's available with many OS distributions, but if you need to install it check out [their website](https://www.openssl.org). Alternativately you can follow [the certificate creation process](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way/blob/master/docs/04-certificate-authority.md) from the original guide. 

## Kubelet

The `kubectl` command line utility is used to interact with the Kubernetes API Server. We'll use it to generate configuration files and manage our cluster remotely.

Download and install `kubectl` [following the guide that corresponds to your OS.](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl) We're using v1.29, latest at the time of writing. 


Verify it's succesfully installed using

```
kubectl version --client
```

The original guide recommends client version 1.21 or higher, so we're good to continue.
